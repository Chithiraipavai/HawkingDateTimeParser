	<h2>NLP Based Hawking Date And Time Parser</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Hawking Parser is a Java-based NLP parser for parsing date and
			time information. As businesses build applications like chatbots,
			smart CRM applications, help desks and other applications leveraging
			natural language processing, developers need tools and libraries that
			can reduce complexity and accelerate application development.</p>
		<p>Hawking Parser uses NLP and other parsing techniques to
			decipher timestamps and other date and time fields. Developers do not
			need to reinvent the wheel for every new app, so they can use Hawking
			Parser to interpret dates and times seamlessly and with context in
			their applications.</p>

		<p>Some of the most popular parsers out there like Heidel Time,
			SuTime and Natty Date time parser are distinctly rule based. As such,
			they often tend to struggle with parsing date/time information where
			more complex factors like context, tense, multiple values and more
			need to be considered.</p>
